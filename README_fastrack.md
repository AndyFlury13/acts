# FASTRACK Integration

This repo exists for the purposes of integrating https://github.com/demelian/fastrack with ACTS. The current work is being done in only a few files:
- /acts/Examples/Run/Reconstruction/Common/RecCKFTracksFastrack.cpp
- /acts/Examples/Run/Reconstruction/Common/RecCKFTracksFastrack.hpp
- /acts/Examples/Run/Reconstruction/Common/CMakeList.txt
Where I am planning on using FASTRACK to do a basic track prediction.
